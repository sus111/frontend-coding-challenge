Task 1:
- Goals.vue expects a 'name' param, so I'm passing the name to the Goals component via router params. It feels like a better way to access the 'name' prop from the router would be directly from the store (ensuring 1 source of truth), however I can't seem to find a way to do that with Vue. In this case, it's not a problem as the functionality works fine.
